# TRANSLATION-FROM-ENGLISH-TO-INDIC-LANGUAGE

• Implemented a transformer based encoder-decoder architecture for en-hi dataset text translation.
• Compared various text translation models like Neural Machine Translation with LSTM, 2-Layer LSTM, 4-Layer LSTM, etc.
• Used BLEU score to evaluate the results.
